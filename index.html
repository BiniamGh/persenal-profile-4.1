  <h1>MEET BINIAM GHEBREHIWET</h1>
  <h2>The future Web Developer!&#128512;</h2>
</header>
  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/fTbF0Zn3/bini.jpg" alt="Birmingham is beautiful, as Biniam is discovering.">

  <p>Biniam was born in Eritrea and relocated to Birmingham in 2014 to continue his education. He completed a basic IT online course from Coursera and received a certificate. He is currently enrolled in distance learning for a bachelor's degree at Open University, and he is also doing a coding course at Code Your Future in Birmingham.</p>
  <p>According to Biniam, he is a blessing to his family. He has one brother who resides in Canada and one sister who lives in Eritrea. He has been away from his family for around 13 years. He invited his family to come to Uganda's capital city of Kampala, where they spent two wonderful weeks together. He hopes that one day, he will be able to see them again.</p>
  <p> Biniam considers Birmingham to be his home; he loves it here, but not more than the town where he was raised. The beauty and exciting activities that Birmigham offers are the key reasons for his affection for the city. Here are some of Biniam's favourite Birmigham activities.</P>
  <h3>Things Biniam loves to do in Birmingham:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>walkign to The City Center</li>
        <li>Going to Jym</li>
        <li>Visiting The Aquarium in City Center</li>
      </ul>
      <ul id="list"></ul><button id="button">Reveal Other Hobbies</button>
      <h3>playing snooker in a cafe with buddies:</h3><button id="next">Next</button> <span><span id="pool"></span></span> <button id="previous">Previous</button>
     <main>
  You now know Biniam's preferences. You might be wondering, "Why tech?" Biniam likes anything computer-related, after 

all. He never took a computer course, but he always attempts to figure out any technical problems on his own. If he 

notices a problem with his laptop, he searches YouTube for fixes. It is the first video he ever saw to help him with a 

problem he was having trouble with.
